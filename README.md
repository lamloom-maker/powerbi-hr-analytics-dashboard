# HR Analytics Decision Support Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents an HR Analytics dashboard designed to support executive and operational decision-making using data-driven insights.  
The dashboard focuses on workforce performance, attrition risk, and employee engagement, enabling HR leaders to identify issues early and take proactive action.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate business and organizational problems into analytical solutions
- Design executive-level dashboards that support decision-making
- Connect HR metrics with strategic outcomes
- Communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

---

## Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to understand the underlying drivers of employee turnover, performance gaps, and workforce inefficiencies.  
Traditional HR reporting focuses on descriptive metrics without providing actionable insights.

This project addresses the question:
**How can HR leaders use data to reduce attrition, improve performance, and optimize workforce planning?**

---

## Why This Matters
- High employee turnover increases operational costs and disrupts productivity
- Workforce performance directly impacts organizational outcomes
- Data-driven HR decisions improve retention, engagement, and planning accuracy

This dashboard enables HR teams to move from reactive reporting to proactive decision-making.
